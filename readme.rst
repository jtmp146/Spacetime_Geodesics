Program to numerically solve the geodesic equation for a given metric tensor. Currently supports Minkowski 
metric (Cartesian and spherical coords), Schwarzschild metric (Schwarzschild and Gullstrand-Painleve coordinates) and
metric for graviational waves far from the source (TT gauge). The solved worldline is represented as a 3D animation.
